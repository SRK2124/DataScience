# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier Project

This project demonstrates the use of a **Decision Tree Classifier** for predictive modeling.  

Decision trees are intuitive, interpretable models widely used in classification problems, making them a strong baseline for supervised learning tasks.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Train and evaluate a decision tree classifier on structured data.  
- **Dataset:** Patient health dataset (tailored data from Switzerland and the US).  
- **Workflow includes:**
  - Data preprocessing and handling missing values
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering and imputation (using KNN and lasso regression techniques)
  - Training a decision tree classifier
  - Hyperparameter tuning (depth, splits and criterion for splitting)
  - Model evaluation using metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (`DecisionTreeClassifier`, `train_test_split`, metrics)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations)  

---

## 🚀 Results

- Imputed missing data using different imputing techniques.
- Built a decision tree model capable of predicting health-related outcomes.  
- Compared model performance across different hyperparameter configurations.  
- Visualized the decision tree structure and key splits.  
- Demonstrated interpretable insights into feature importance.
