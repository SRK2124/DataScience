# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project applies **clustering analysis** on a customer dataset to perform **customer segmentation**.

Customer segmentation is a crucial technique in marketing and business strategy, as it helps identify distinct groups of customers based on shared characteristics, enabling better targeting and resource allocation.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Segment customers into groups using unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering).  
- **Dataset:** Customer information dataset ([source](https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/Cust_Segmentation.csv)).

- **Techniques used:**
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values
  - Feature selection (removing irrelevant features like categorical addresses & IDs)
  - Data normalization with `StandardScaler`
  - Applying **K-Means clustering** and **DBSCAN Algorithm**
  - Using the **Elbow Method** to identify the optimal number of clusters
  - Visualizing clusters and interpreting centroid values
  - Comparing advantages and disadvantages of both the methods.
