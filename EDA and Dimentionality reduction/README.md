# 📊 EDA & Dimensionality Reduction: Diabetes Dataset

This notebook demonstrates a complete workflow for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and dimensionality reduction on the Modified Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It covers data cleaning, visualization, imputation, standardization, and advanced dimensionality reduction techniques.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Explore, clean, visualize, and reduce the dimensionality of a real-world health dataset to extract insights and prepare for further modeling.

- **Dataset Used:**
  - Modified Pima Indians Diabetes Database (`dataset/diabetes.csv`)

- **Key Techniques:**
  - Data cleaning and imputation (mean strategy)
  - Exploratory data visualization (boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, grouped bar charts)
  - Feature standardization (scikit-learn)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (SimpleImputer, StandardScaler, PCA, MDS)

---

## 🧠 Methods & Tasks

### 1. Data Loading & Inspection
- Load the diabetes dataset and inspect its structure and summary statistics.

### 2. Missing Value Analysis & Imputation
- Identify missing or invalid values and impute them using both scikit-learn and a custom function.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Visualize feature distributions and relationships using various plots.
- Explore age and pregnancy groupings in relation to diabetes outcome.

### 4. Standardization
- Standardize features (excluding the target) to zero mean and unit variance.

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction
- Apply PCA to reduce feature space and analyze variance contributions.
- Use MDS to visualize high-dimensional data in two dimensions.

## 🚀 Results

- Cleaned and imputed dataset ready for modeling.
- Visualizations reveal key patterns and relationships in the data.
- PCA and MDS provide insight into the structure and separability of the dataset.
